# gibmod

Development repo for GibMod, a silly viscera-based addon for Garry's Mod

Download and install the latest version via the [Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=168326910)

## help, it lags horribly!
Try enabling performance mode with *gibmod_perfmode 1*

This will decrease a lot of the more resource-intensive settings GibMod uses, such as the amount of gibs and effects, by multiplying them by *gibmod_perffactor*. The effects won't look as elaborate, but you should get better performance.

In multiplayer, the biggest bottleneck is usually bandwidth.  
Decreasing the number of gibs helps, but ultimately what will prevail is a better internet connection for the server.

```lua
-- hook called when player or npc dies so you can do stuff with the ragdoll
function myHook( ent, exploded, ragdoll )
    -- ent       = entity that died (can be player or npc!)
    -- exploded  = true if entity exploded and created no ragdoll
    -- ragdoll   = entity's ragdoll or nil if exploded
    print( ent, exploded, ragdoll )
